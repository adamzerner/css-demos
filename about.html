<ul>
  <li>I want to demonstrate <em>discrete</em> things. I could have had a demo of "Block elements have vertical and horizontal margins", but I chose to separate it into two: "Block elements have vertical margins" and "Block elements have horizontal margins".
    <ol>
      <li>To someone who's experienced, it may seem obvious that they have veritcal and horizontal margins, but to someone who's new, it isn't obvious. I think that to someone who's new, it's helpful to separate the demo into two, because doing so makes it clearer and more explicit that they're both true.</li>
      <li>I think of this like a unit test.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>I want to be thorough. A lot of documentation and tutorials say a lot of words and include a few demos, but I wanted to demonstrate <em>everything</em>. I think that this is very effective and reduces the chances of things "falling through the cracks".</li>
  <li>This project is definitely aligned with the "learning through examples" philosophy.</li>
  <li>CodePen is cool, but it's hard to inspect the HTML/CSS with the dev tools. So I wanted to provide an HTML page that is stripped down to the absolute essentials for you to play with.</li>
  <li>That said, CodePen is definitely cool, and I wanted to include that as well.</li>
  <li>Video explanations are awesome! Sometimes they're the best tool for the job. I think they're very very underused in documentation and tutorials.</li>
  <li>I think that it's nice to have the option to see the YouTube videos + CodePens inline.
    <ol>
      <li>You get to see both at the same time.</li>
      <li>You don't lose track of where you were in the page.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
